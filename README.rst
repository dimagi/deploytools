This repository is a set of frequently reused scripts and tools for a django deployment on a production environment.

These tools make a few assumptions:

1:  You use upstart for your init scripting
2:  You use virtualenv for your python environments
3:  You plan on putting your project in a directory relative to this project dir
4:  You run django the way we run django.
